      <p>The process of signing up as a nodal center is different from signing up as a regular user i.e. a donor or recipient. A nodal center is expected to be a point of mutual exchange between the recipient and the donor. To sign up for the same, you have to first select the option to sign up as a nodal point, then select your location on the map and fill in your complete address ,and then submit your application. After this, once your submission has been  reviewed, youâ€™ll be able to start functioning as a nodal point from the location you picked.

        <div class="answers">
          <p>Maybe you have been a member of the Anndata Community for a while, but you're still awaiting your first request for food/ration Or maybe you have received a request but suddenly you didn't receive anymore. Both circumstances can make you wonder if something is not right or you're doing something wrong. However, both instances are very common. there could be many more Donors compared to recipients in your locality/ area and that is a scenario we all are working towards. Please wait and you would sure have an opportunity to help someone.

          <p>
            Our service matches the donor to recipients in a particular locality /area. there may be more recipients than donors at any point in time and therefore the request made by you may not be meeting any specific donors ability to give food/ration.  You may want to update your requests with different quantity of food/ ration.</div>
